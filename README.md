# ECommerce_Sales_Dashboard
 I have built an interactive dashboard on Power BI for ECommerce Sales. Used complex parameters to drill down in worksheets and customization using filters and slicers.
Created connections, join new tables, and calculations to manipulate data, and enable user-driven parameters for visualizations. Used different types of customized visualizations(bar chart, donut chart, clustered bar chart, line chart, slicers, etc)



The project aimed to find the highest profitable state and the category then target the customers and give them a 5% discount. This will make customers happy leading to their loyalty towards the brand.



Project Workflow: 

ðŸ”¸Understand the aim and dataset

ðŸ”¸ Transform the data 

ðŸ”¸ Built Charts and apply filters that align the objective

ðŸ”¸ Format the dashboard and analyze the data

ðŸ”¸ Capturing the key Insights needed to fulfill the aim



Some of the Key Insights observed are:

ðŸ”˜ Top performing state is Madhya Pradesh where maximum profit is obtained about 7K. 

ðŸ”˜ Indore and Bhopal are active cities in Madhya Pradesh. 

Products are divided into 3 categories they are Clothing, Electronics, and Furniture.

ðŸ”˜ Max. profit for Clothing is observed in Bhopal and for Electronics and Furniture in Indore.

ðŸ”˜ Sales of Sarees are the highest in Bhopal from the Clothing category. So we can give discounts to those customers who buy sarees in Bhopal leading to customer loyalty to the brand. The top 3 customers who buy sarees in Bhopal are Abhijeet, Parna, and Tulika.

ðŸ”˜ Similarly, the sales of the sub-categories Electronic games and Bookcases are the highest in Indore and the top customers contributing these sales are:

Electronic games: Bhavna, Anudeep, and Vaibhav.

Bookcases: Sakshi, Chiku, and Vaibhav

ðŸ”˜It is observed that Vaibhav is buying both Electronic games and Bookcases, so a special discount card or membership card can be offered to him. 

ðŸ”˜ Lastly, Payment is accepted as a COD by most of the customers.
